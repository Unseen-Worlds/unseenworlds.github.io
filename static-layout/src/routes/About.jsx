          Unseen Worlds is a record label releasing quality editions of
          unheralded and revolutionary, yet accessible, avant garde music. We
          are interested in media that capture a timeless ecstasy of creativity,
          that seem out of space, alien, yet are deeply resonant and
          approachable. They are both primary and mysterious. They contain
          multitudes, engaging the listener through their historical context and
          sheer musicality. Our releases are surprisingly disparate and
          reliable.
